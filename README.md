# Python_basic_project
The "Encode and Decode" Python project is a straightforward yet powerful tool for encoding
messages with a mix of unique symbols and random characters.
Main goal is to improve message security by encoding them in a format that is difficult to read. The
project also incorporates a decoding method to extract the original message from the encoded
format.
